                        <p>Dial Anyone is not intended to support or carry emergency calls to any emergency services (such as 911, 999, 112, etc.). We are not a replacement for your ordinary mobile or fixed-line telephone. You should ensure you have alternative means of making emergency calls.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">5. Service Availability and Quality</h4>
                        <p>While we strive to provide high-quality service, we cannot guarantee that:</p>
                        <ul>

                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>The Service depends on many factors outside our control, including Internet connectivity, network conditions, and local infrastructure in destination countries.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">6. Credits and Payments</h4>

                        <p>Call rates vary by destination and may change without notice. You are responsible for checking the current rates before making calls.</p>
                        
                        <p>If you enable auto top-up, you authorize us to automatically charge your payment method when your credits fall below the specified threshold.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">7. Content and Recording</h4>

We do not record your calls as a standard feature, but you acknowledge that if you use any recording functionality, you will obtain all necessary consents.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="mt-4">8. Termination</h4>
